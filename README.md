# A-Pipeline-for-Analysis-of-scRNA-Sequence-Data

## Highlights of Research:
• This research successfully addressed the challenges in anaylyzing the scRNA-sequence datasets, primarily focusing on data sparsity and computational complexity. <br>
• Developed a pipeline starting with dimensionality reduction on data, followed by clustering to get the cluster labels. <br>
• Performed multi-class classification task to predict the cell labels, resulting in some near-to-perfect accuracy scores on the test set. <br>
• This whole pipeline’s outcome showcases the effectiveness of approach in handling high dimensional scRNA-sequence datasets for further insights. <br>
