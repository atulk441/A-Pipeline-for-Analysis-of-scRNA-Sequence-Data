# A-Pipeline-for-Analysis-of-scRNA-Sequence-Data

## Highlights of Research:
• This research successfully addressed the challenges in analyzing the scRNA-sequence datasets, primarily focusing on data sparsity and computational complexity.
• Developed a pipeline starting with dimensionality reduction on data, followed by clustering to get the cluster labels.
• Performed multi-class classification task to predict the cell labels, resulting in some near-to-perfect accuracy scores on the test set.
• This whole pipeline’s outcome showcases the effectiveness of approach in handling high dimensional scRNA-sequence datasets for further insights.
